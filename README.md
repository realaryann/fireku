## üìù About

FireKu bundles virtual remotes for Roku and FireTV into a single application. It offers automatic device
discovery on a LAN using the SSDP, part of the UPnP family of UDP protocols using port 1900. 

The backend service is split into two:
1) Roku: It utilizes the Roku REST API/ECP to POST required button commands to the device ip and port
2) FireTV: It utilizes the Android Debug Bridge to spin subprocesses to send button values to the FireTV ip.
